Directions: First Expression
Write an expression that uses at least 3 different arithmetic operators.

The expression should equal 42.

Hint: +, -, *, /, and % are possible arithmetic operators

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: First Expression (2-1)
 *
 * Write an expression that uses at least three, different, arithmetic operators
 * to log the number 42 to the console.
 */

// this expression equals 4, change it to equal 42
console.log(10 * 2 + 23 - 1);
console.log(1 + 5 - 2 + 38);
console.log(80/2 +10 -8);
console.log(2%4 +40);


Directions: Converting Tempatures
Use this equation and the variables fahrenheit and celsius to print the Fahrenheit equivalent of 12°C.

NOTE: "12°C" reads as "12 degrees Celsius".

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: Converting Tempatures (2-2)
 *
 * The Celsius-to-Fahrenheit formula:
 *
 *    F = C x 1.8 + 32
 *
 * 1. Set the fahrenheit variable to the correct value using the celsius variable and the forumla above
 * 2. Log the fahrenheit variable to the console
 *
 */

var celsius = 12;
var fahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32/* convert celsius to fahrenheit here */

console.log(fahrenheit);/* print out result here */


Directions: Favorite Food
Create a string with the name of your favorite food. The first letter of the string should be capitalized.

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: Favorite Food (2-3)
 */
var favoriteFood = "Steak"
console.log(favoriteFood);/* replace this comment with your string */


Directions: String Equality for All
Fix the right side expression so it evaluates to true.

"ALL Strings are CrEaTeD equal" == "All STRINGS are CrEaTED Equal"
Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: String Equality for All (2-4)
 */

// fix the right side of the expression
var answer = "ALL Strings are CrEaTeD equal" == "ALL Strings are CrEaTeD equal";
console.log(answer);


Directions: All Tied Up
Build a single string that resembles the following joke.

Why couldn't the shoes go out and play?
They were all "tied" up!
Your joke should take the format of a question and answer. The first line should be a question and the second line should be an answer.

Hint: You will need to use special characters to produce the following output.

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: All Tied Up (2-5)
 */
 
var question = "Why couldn't the shoes go out and play?";
var answer = "They were all \"tied\" up!";
var joke = "Why couldn't the shoes go out and play?\n\They were all \"tied\" up!";
console.log(joke);


Directions: Yosa Buson 
Build a string using concatenation by combining the lines from this famous haiku poem by Yosa Buson.

Blowing from the west
Fallen leaves gather
In the east.
Each string should be printed on its own line.

Hint: You will need to use special characters to produce the following output. For a refresher, feel free to review the previous Escaping Strings lesson in this course.

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: Yosa Buson (2-6)
 */

var haiku = "Blowing from the west\n" + "Fallen leaves gather\n" + "In the east.";
console.log(haiku);


Directions: Semicolons!
Define two variables called thingOne and thingTwo and assign them values. Print the values of both variables in one console.log statement using concatenation. For example,

red blue
where "red" is the value of thingOne and "blue" is the value of thingTwo. Don't forget to use semicolons!

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: Semicolons! (2-8)
 */

// your code goes here
var thingOne = "red"; var thingTwo = "blue";
console.log(thingOne + thingTwo);


Directions: What's my name?
Create a variable called fullName and assign it your full name as a string.

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: What's my Name? (2-9)
 */

// your code goes here
var fullName = "Klaosiroth"
console.log(fullName)


Directions: Out to Diner
Create a variable called bill and assign it the result of 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15 (don't perform the calculation yourself, let JavaScript do it!). Next, create a variable called tip and assign it the result of multiplying bill by a 15% tip rate. Finally, add the bill and tip together and store it into a variable called total.

Print the total to the JavaScript console.

Hint: 15% in decimal form is written as 0.15_._

TIP: To print out the total with a dollar sign ( $ ) use string concatenation. To round total up by two decimal points use the toFixed() method. To use toFixed() pass it the number of decimal points you want to use. For example, if total equals 3.9860, then total.toFixed(2) would return 3.99.

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: Out to Dinner (2-10)
 */

// your code goes here
var bill = 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15;
var tip = 0.15 * bill;
var total= tip + bill;
console.log("$" + total.toFixed(2));


Directions: Mad Libs
Mad Libs is a word game where players have fun substituting words for blanks in a story. For this exercise, use the adjective variables below to fill in the blanks and complete the following message.

"The Intro to JavaScript course is __________. James and Julia are so __________. I cannot wait to work through the rest of this __________ content!"
var adjective1 = "amazing";
var adjective2 = "fun";
var adjective3 = "entertaining";
Assign the resulting string to a variable called madLib.

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: MadLibs (2-11)
 * 
 * 1. Declare a madLib variable
 * 2. Use the adjective1, adjective2, and adjective3 variables to set the madLib variable to the message:
 * 
 * 'The Intro to JavaScript course is amazing. James and Julia are so fun. I cannot wait to work through the rest of this entertaining content!'
 */

var adjective1 = "amazing";
var adjective2 = "fun";
var adjective3 = "entertaining";
var madLib = "The Intro to JavaScript course is " + adjective1 + ". James and Julia are so " + adjective2 + ". I cannot wait to work through the rest of this " + adjective3 + " content!";
// your code goes here
console.log(madLib)


Directions: One Awesome Message
Here are two awesome messages:

Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games.
Hi, my name is James. I love baseball. In my spare time, I like to read.
Declare and assign values to three variables for each part of the sentence that changes (firstName, interest, and hobby).

Use your variables and string concatenation to create your own awesome message and store it in an awesomeMessage variable. Finally, print your awesome message to the JavaScript console.

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: One Awesome Message (2-12)
 *
 * 1. Create the following variables:
 *     - firstName
 *     - interest
 *     - hobby
 * 2. Create a variable named awesomeMessage and set it to an awesome message using
      string concatenation and the variables above.
 * 3. Log the awesomeMessage variable to the console.
 */

/*
 * Notes:
 * - The `awesomeMessage` should have the format of:
 *   Hi, my name is _____. I love _____. In my spare time, I like to _______.
 *
 * - Using the above as an example, firstName would have been assigned to "Julia",
 *   interest to "cats", and hobby to "play video games" to produce the message:
 *   Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games.
 *
 * - Be sure to include spaces and periods where necessary!
 */

// Add your code here
var firstName = "Julia";
var interest = "cats";
var hobby = "play video games";

var awesomeMessage = "Hi, my name is "+ firstName + "." + " I love " + interest + "." +  " In my spare time, I like to "+ hobby + ".";
console.log(awesomeMessage);
