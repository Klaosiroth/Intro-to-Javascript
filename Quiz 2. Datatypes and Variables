Create a variable called bill and assign it the result of 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15 (don't perform the calculation yourself, let JavaScript do it!). Next, create a variable called tip and assign it the result of multiplying bill by a 15% tip rate. Finally, add the bill and tip together and store it into a variable called total.

Print the total to the JavaScript console.

Hint: 15% in decimal form is written as 0.15_._

TIP: To print out the total with a dollar sign ( $ ) use string concatenation. To round total up by two decimal points use the toFixed() method. To use toFixed() pass it the number of decimal points you want to use. For example, if total equals 3.9860, then total.toFixed(2) would return 3.99.

Mad Libs is a word game where players have fun substituting words for blanks in a story. For this exercise, use the adjective variables below to fill in the blanks and complete the following message.

"The Intro to JavaScript course is __________. James and Julia are so __________. I cannot wait to work through the rest of this __________ content!"
var adjective1 = "amazing";
var adjective2 = "fun";
var adjective3 = "entertaining";
Assign the resulting string to a variable called madLib.

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: MadLibs (2-11)
 * 
 * 1. Declare a madLib variable
 * 2. Use the adjective1, adjective2, and adjective3 variables to set the madLib variable to the message:
 * 
 * 'The Intro to JavaScript course is amazing. James and Julia are so fun. I cannot wait to work through the rest of this entertaining content!'
 */

var adjective1 = "amazing";
var adjective2 = "fun";
var adjective3 = "entertaining";
var madLib = "The Intro to JavaScript course is " + adjective1 + ". James and Julia are so " + adjective2 + ". I cannot wait to work through the rest of this " + adjective3 + " content!";
// your code goes here
console.log(madLib)

Here are two awesome messages:

Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games.
Hi, my name is James. I love baseball. In my spare time, I like to read.
Declare and assign values to three variables for each part of the sentence that changes (firstName, interest, and hobby).

Use your variables and string concatenation to create your own awesome message and store it in an awesomeMessage variable. Finally, print your awesome message to the JavaScript console.

Your Code:
/*
 * Programming Quiz: One Awesome Message (2-12)
 *
 * 1. Create the following variables:
 *     - firstName
 *     - interest
 *     - hobby
 * 2. Create a variable named awesomeMessage and set it to an awesome message using
      string concatenation and the variables above.
 * 3. Log the awesomeMessage variable to the console.
 */

/*
 * Notes:
 * - The `awesomeMessage` should have the format of:
 *   Hi, my name is _____. I love _____. In my spare time, I like to _______.
 *
 * - Using the above as an example, firstName would have been assigned to "Julia",
 *   interest to "cats", and hobby to "play video games" to produce the message:
 *   Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games.
 *
 * - Be sure to include spaces and periods where necessary!
 */

// Add your code here
var firstName = "Julia";
var interest = "cats";
var hobby = "play video games";

var awesomeMessage = "Hi, my name is "+ firstName + "." + " I love " + interest + "." +  " In my spare time, I like to "+ hobby + ".";
console.log(awesomeMessage);
